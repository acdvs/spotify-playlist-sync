## [Spotify Playlist Sync][website]

A simple tool to sync Spotify playlists to other accounts without publicly sharing, collaborating, or saving.

### Motivation

With current Spotify playlist sharing functionality, you can either:

- Share a playlist, which does nothing special
- Like a playlist, which retains ownership and creates a reference on your account
- Add a collaborator, which combines ownership with another account

However, you aren't able to _transfer_ ownership. Copying the playlist to another account solves this.
