## [Spotify Playlist Sync][website]

A simple tool to sync Spotify playlists to other accounts without publicly sharing or saving.

### Motivation

With current Spotify playlist sharing functionality, you can either:

- Share a playlist, which performs no action at all
- Like a playlist, which retains authorship and creates a reference
- Add a collaborator, which combines authorships

However, I needed a way to publicize some playlists on my personal Spotify account **without** having my name attached to them in any way. This tool simply makes use of a single Spotify endpoint to copy all songs from one playlist to another, also allowing usage of private playlists on either account.
